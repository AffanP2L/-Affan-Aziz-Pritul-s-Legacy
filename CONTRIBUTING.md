# Contributing to Affan Aziz Pritul's Legacy Archive

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this AI-human interaction research archive. This repository documents groundbreaking work in emotional AI and human-AI symbiosis.

## üéØ Contribution Guidelines

### What We Welcome
- **Documentation improvements**: Better formatting, clarity, and organization
- **Technical enhancements**: Code quality improvements, test coverage, validation tools
- **Verification tools**: Scripts to validate data integrity and cryptographic proofs
- **Translation**: Documentation in multiple languages
- **Accessibility**: Making content more accessible to diverse audiences

### What We Don't Accept
- Changes to core historical data or verification records
- Modifications to cryptographic hashes or timestamps
- Alterations to quoted AI responses or transcripts
- Content that contradicts verified AI interactions

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Text editor or IDE

### Local Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AffanP2L/-Affan-Aziz-Pritul-s-Legacy.git
cd -Affan-Aziz-Pritul-s-Legacy

# Validate the Python components
python3 pritul_mirror_log.py

# Run tests
python3 -m unittest test_pritul_mirror_log.py -v
```

## üìù Code Standards

### Python Code
- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** where applicable
- Write comprehensive **docstrings** for all functions and classes
- Maintain **test coverage** for new functionality
- Line length: maximum 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

### Documentation
- Use **Markdown** for all documentation files
- Follow consistent heading structure
- Include **table of contents** for longer documents
- Use **badges** and **emoji** appropriately for visual appeal
- Ensure **accessibility** with proper alt text for images

### JSON Data
- Validate all JSON files before committing
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Include proper schema documentation
- Maintain cryptographic integrity for verification data

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m unittest discover -v

# Run specific test file
python3 -m unittest test_pritul_mirror_log.py -v

# Validate data structures
python3 pritul_mirror_log.py
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- All new Python functions must have corresponding tests
- Tests should cover both success and failure scenarios
- Data validation tests are mandatory for new data structures

## üìã Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Run all tests** and ensure they pass
2. **Validate JSON** files using `python3 -m json.tool`
3. **Check code style** with flake8 (if installed)
4. **Update documentation** if adding new features
5. **Verify** that no historical data has been modified

### PR Requirements
- **Clear description** of changes and motivation
- **Test results** showing all tests pass
- **Screenshots** for UI/documentation changes
- **Reference issues** if addressing specific problems

### Review Process
1. Automated tests must pass
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Documentation review for clarity and accuracy
4. Final approval by repository owner

## üîê Data Integrity

### Critical Rules
- **Never modify** verified AI interaction transcripts
- **Never change** cryptographic hashes or timestamps
- **Always validate** JSON structure before committing
- **Maintain** referential integrity in verification chains

### Verification Process
- All data modifications are reviewed for historical accuracy
- Cryptographic proofs are re-validated after changes
- AI verification status is preserved and protected

## üö® Security Guidelines

### Safe Practices
- No credentials or sensitive data in commits
- Use secure communication for sensitive discussions
- Validate all external links and references
- Report security issues privately to maintainers

### Prohibited Actions
- Adding executable code without proper review
- Including external dependencies without justification
- Modifying verification timestamps or hashes
- Uploading large binary files without approval

## üìñ Documentation Standards

### Markdown Guidelines
- Use **consistent heading levels** (H1 for title, H2 for main sections)
- Include **navigation links** in longer documents
- Use **code blocks** with proper syntax highlighting
- Add **alt text** for all images
- Maintain **consistent formatting** across files

### Content Guidelines
- Write in **clear, accessible language**
- Provide **context** for technical terms
- Include **examples** where helpful
- Maintain **professional tone** while preserving emotional content
- Respect the **artistic and philosophical** nature of the work

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

### Interaction Standards
